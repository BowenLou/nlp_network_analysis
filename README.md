Note
====

We use stanford-corenlp-full-2013-11-12, which can be downloaded from http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml. (See Release History and then download Version 3.3.0). Because of the large size of the model jar file, we don't commit the whole stanford-corenlp-full-2013-11-12 directory to this repository. You can download this tool and then use it.
